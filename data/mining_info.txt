COAL MINING IN INDIA: THE PAST
India has a long history of commercial coal mining covering nearly 220 years starting from 1774 by M/s Sumner and Heatly of East India Company in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of river Damodar. However, for about a century the growth of Indian coal mining remained sluggish for want of demand but the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853 gave a fillip to it. Within a short span, production rose to an annual average of 1 million tonne (mt) and India could produce 6.12 mts. per year by 1900 and 18 mts per year by 1920. The production got a sudden boost from the First World War but went through a slump in the early thirties. The production reached a level of 29 mts. by 1942 and 30 mts. by 1946.
With the advent of Independence, the country embarked upon the 5-year development plans. At the beginning of the 1st Plan, annual production went upto 33 mts. During the 1st Plan period itself, the need for increasing coal production efficiently by systematic and scientific development of the coal industry was being felt. Setting up of the National Coal Development Corporation (NCDC), a Government of India Undertaking in 1956 with the collieries owned by the railways as its nucleus was the first major step towards planned development of Indian Coal Industry. Along with the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) which was already in operation since 1945 and which became a Government company under the control of Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1956, India thus had two Government coal companies in the fifties. SCCL is now a joint undertaking of Government of Andhra Pradesh and Government of India sharing its equity in 51:49 ratio.

NATIONALISATION OF COAL MINES

Right from its genesis, the commercial coal mining in modern times in India has been dictated by the needs of the domestic consumption. On account of the growing needs of the steel industry, a thrust had to be given on systematic exploitation of coking coal reserves in Jharia Coalfield. Adequate capital investment to meet the burgeoning energy needs of the country was not forthcoming from the private coal mine owners. Unscientific mining practices adopted by some of them and poor working conditions of labour in some of the private coal mines became matters of concern for the Government. On account of these reasons, the Central Government took a decision to nationalise the private coal mines. The nationalisation was done in two phases, the first with the coking coal mines in 1971-72 and then with the non-coking coal mines in 1973. In October, 1971, the Coking Coal Mines (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1971 provided for taking over in public interest of the management of coking coal mines and coke oven plants pending nationalisation. This was followed by the Coking Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1972 under which the coking coal mines and the coke oven plants other than those with the Tata Iron & Steel Company Limited and Indian Iron & Steel Company Limited, were nationalised on 1.5.1972 and brought under the Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), a new Central Government Undertaking. Another enactment, namely the Coal Mines (Taking Over of Management) Act, 1973, extended the right of the Government of India to take over the management of the coking and non-coking coal mines in seven States including the coking coal mines taken over in 1971. This was followed by the nationalisation of all these mines on 1.5.1973 with the enactment of the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973 which now is the piece of Central legislation determining the eligibility of coal mining in India.

Coal is the most important and abundant fossil fuel in India. It accounts for 55% of the country's energy need. The country's industrial heritage was built upon indigenous coal.
Commercial primary energy consumption in India has grown by about 700% in the last four decades. The current per capita commercial primary energy consumption in India is about 350 kgoe/year which is well below that of developed countries. Driven by the rising population, expanding economy and a quest for improved quality of life, energy usage in India is expected to rise. Considering the limited reserve potentiality of petroleum & natural gas, eco-conservation restriction on hydel project and geo-political perception of nuclear power, coal will continue to occupy centre-stage of India 's energy scenario.
Indian coal offers a unique ecofriendly fuel source to domestic energy market for the next century and beyond. Hard coal deposit spread over 27 major coalfields, are mainly confined to eastern and south central parts of the the country.(See Coal Reserves).The lignite reserves stand at a level around 36 billion tonnes, of which 90 % occur in the southern State of Tamil Nadu.

COAL PRODUCTION
Through sustained programme of investment and greater thrust on application of modern technologies, it has been possible to raise the All India production of coal at 778.21million tonnes in 2021-22. The all India Production of coal during 2022-23 was 893.19 MT with a positive growth of14.77%.
Coal India Limited (CIL) and its subsidiaries accounted for 622.63 MT during 2021-22 as compared to a production of 596.22 MT in 2020-21 showing a positive growth of 4.4%. Coal production of CIL during 2022-23 was 703.20 MT with a positive growth of 12.94%.
Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) is the main source for supply of coal to the southern region. The company produced 65.02 million tonnes of coal during 2021-22 as against 50.58 MT during the same period of previous year. SCCL production of coal during 2022-23 was 67.14 MT with a positive growth of 3.26%. Small quantities of coal are also produced by TISCO, IISCO, DVC and others.

COAL DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING
The Marketing Division of CIL coordinates marketing activities for all its subsidiaries. CIL has set up Regional Sales Offices and Sub-Sales Offices at selected places in the country to cater to the needs of the consuming sectors in various regions.
IMPORT OF COAL
As per the present Import policy, coal can be freely imported (under Open General Licence) by the consumers themselves considering their needs based on their commercial consideration.
Coking Coal is being imported by Steel sector mainly to bridge the gap between the requirement and indigenous availability and to improve the quality. Other sectors like Power sector, cement etc. and coal traders are importing non-coking coal.

The Ministry of Coal has the overall responsibility of determining policies and strategies in respect of exploration and development of coal and lignite reserves, sanctioning of important projects of high value and for deciding all related issues. Under the administrative control of the Ministry, these key functions are exercised through the Public Sector Undertakings, namely, Coal India Ltd. and its subsidiaries and Neyveli Lignite corporation India Limited (NLCIL). Other than Coal India Ltd. and Neyveli Lignite Corporation India Ltd., the Ministry of Coal also has a joint venture with Government of Telangana called Singareni Collieries Company Limited. Government of Telangana holds 51% equity and Government of India holds 49 % equity.

About Sustainable Division

The adoption of sustainable development principles in coal mining sector has been gaining ground over the years. Ministry of Coal not only envisions to secure availability of coal to meet the rising energy demand of various sectors but also prioritise due care for local environment and host community. Coal sector envisages to promote sustainable development model in which coal production goes hand in hand with environmental protection, resource conservation, care for society and measures to protect our forests and biodiversity.
With the above goals in forefront, Ministry of Coal has established ‘Sustainable Development Cell (SDC)’ in December 2019 to promote environmentally sustainable coal mining in the country and to address concerns during mining operation and till the decommissioning or final closure of mines. This move gains more importance as new private entities are now going to form a significant part of future coal supply matrix. Subsequently, the SDC emerged as Sustainability & Just Transition (S & JT) Division consisting Sustainable Development Cell (SDC) & Just Transition (JT) Section. Recognizing the importance of bringing sustainability in coal mining, Sustainable Development Cells (SDC) have also been established in all Coal/Lignite PSUs with following objectives to improve the overall image of coal sector in the country:
•To advise, mentor, plan & monitor the mitigation measures taken by Coal/Lignite PSUs for maximising resource utilisation in a sustainable way.
•To minimise the adverse impact of mining and establish a sustainable environment around coal regions to improve ecosystem services
•To share and replicate the best practices of sustainable mining
•To take up the issues of carbon neutrality, mine closure based on just transition principles & climate change.
•To disseminate best practices of sustainability through reports, films, documentaries etc. 
Role of S & JT Division
The S & JT Division advises, mentors, plans and monitors the mitigation measures taken by coal companies for maximising the utilisation of available resources in a sustainable way, minimising the adverse impact of mining and mitigating it for further ecosystem services. It deals the matters related to climate change, sustainable development goals (SDGs), just transition and sustainability of coal sector.
S & JT Division adopts a systemic approach, starting from collection of data, analysis of data, presentation of information, planning by domain experts, adoption of best practices, consultations, innovative thinking, site-specific approaches, knowledge sharing and dissemination with an aim to ease the lives of people and communities residing in and around mining areas.

All the initiatives contribute directly or indirectly with the Mission LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment) focusing on sustainability and community development launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister in October 2022.

Greening Initiatives in coal sector

Coal/lignite PSUs have not only enhanced their production level over the years to meet the rising energy demand of the country but also shown their sensitivity and care towards native environment by adopting various mitigation measures including reclamation of mined out areas and extensive plantation in and around coal bearing areas.
Returning the land disturbed by mining to stable and productive post-mining land uses is fundamental to responsible environmental stewardship. This means that the activities like ecological reclamation of mined out land and overburden dumps, plantation in and around mines, avenue plantation, and restoration of flora and fauna must go side by side along with mining with an aim to leave a lighter mining footprint after the closure of mining.
Coal/Lignite PSUs have been making constant and sincere efforts to minimize the footprints of coal mining through sustained reclamation and afforestation of areas in and around its operating mines.The reclamation activities are being carried out in various mines as per well-designed and approved mine closure plans, which carrydetailed provisions with regard toProgressive as well asFinal Mine Closure activities.
Mined out areas, OB dumps and other disturbed areas are concurrently reclaimed as soon as they get delinked from active mining zone. Top soil is segregated and stored in clearly demarcated area for use within the mine as soon the backfilling and concurrent reclamation starts. Three tier biological reclamation in both external and internal dumps is undertaken through expert agencies i.e. State Forest Development Corporations. Species for biological reclamation are selected in consultation with expert agencies like SFDC, ICFRE, NEERI etc.
The use of innovative techniques such as seed ball plantation, seed casting through drones, and Miyawaki plantation in various mines are in place. These afforestation activities and green belt development arrest the suspended dust particles emitted during mining operations and help to control air pollution. These efforts are being rigorously monitored using remote sensing technology

Energy Efficiency Measures

Efficient use of energy resources and their conservation assume tremendous significance as one unit of energy saved at the consumption level reduces the need for fresh capacity creation by 2 times to 2.5 times. Further, such saving through efficient use of energy can be achieved at less than one-fifth the cost of fresh capacity creation. Most importantly, energy conservation also translates into reduction of carbon footprint. Coal companies also have several areas for implementing energy efficiency measures:
•Colonies, buildings, offices, industrial establishments, rest houses etc.
•Various mining activities – HEMM, Transport, Ventilation, Pumping etc.
•Efficient Power Supply Management and many other avenues
Coal companies have been taking of various energy conservation and efficiency measures over the years and have envisaged various efficiency measures to be taken in coming years:
Reducing electricity /diesel consumption by taking appropriate measures after comprehensive energy audit
Replacing conventional lights by LED lights
Replacing conventional ACs and other appliances by energy efficient Star rated appliances
Installation of capacitor banks and other measures to improve power factor
Use of auto-timers in street lights
Use of Energy efficient pumps (EESL)
Deploying E-Vehicles (EESL)
By implementing various energy efficiency measures, Coal/lignite PSUs have envisaged to create additional carbon offset potential of 1 Lakh Ton/annum.
CIL has signed MOU with EESL to implement Energy Efficiency Programs at CIL and Subsidiaries. This shall cover Building Energy Efficiency Projects (BEEP), Replacement of old fans, ACs and conventional light fittings, motors, adoption of e-vehicle, installation of distributed and rooftop solar projects.
Coal companies have been taking of various energy conservation and efficiency measures in last 2 years such as replacement of 3.25 lakh conventional lights with LED lights, 3682 energy efficient ACs, 41709 Super Fans, deployment of 100 E-vehicles, 1227 Efficient Water Heaters, 234 Energy Efficient Motors for Pumps, 2114 Auto-timer in street lights and installation of Capacitor Banks and have envisaged many more efficiency measures to be taken in coming years.
